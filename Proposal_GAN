General:

Possible CI techniques include, but are not limited to: swarm intelligence (ACO, PSO, ...), fuzzy computation, neural computation, rough sets, artificial immune systems, belief networks and evolutionary computation.

Four possible scenarios:

- Study a specific CI technique or particular application domain.
- In-depth analysis of specific (sub)topic - read relevant papers, re-write them and reproduce part of experimental work
- Ask the lecturer for project idea
- Choose ready-to-go project
